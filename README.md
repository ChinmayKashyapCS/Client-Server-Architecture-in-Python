# 📡 Client-Server Architecture in Python

This project demonstrates a basic **Client-Server Architecture** implementation in Python using sockets, where a server listens for connections and a client connects to send and receive data.

---

## 🧠 Overview

Client-server architecture is a foundational networking model in which multiple clients send requests to a central server, and the server processes those requests and returns responses. In this project, the server continuously listens for incoming client connections and communicates with the client using Python’s socket programming. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
